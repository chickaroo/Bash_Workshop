# Bash_Workshop
CompBioSoc 2025 Bash Workshop

See the exercise markdown files for the exercises to be completed during (or after) the workshop. 
The slides are for a short introduction to the command line and bash scripting. 

Please note that the first exercise does not immediately relate to biology. This is because we need to understand the fundamentals before incorperating more complexity through biological data. Not to worry though, the bash scripting and challenge exercises deal with protein and DNA sequences. Generally, bash skills are an important tool to help you in future projects, not necessarily a specific computational biology idea or topic. Nevertheless, being confident in the command line is essential as a computational biologist! 

## Prerequisites

### Mac/Linux: 
Your regular terminal. 

### Windows: 
Use Git Bash (install (here)[https://git-scm.com/install/windows]) or better yet install a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for full functionality. (Here)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install] are helpful instructions on how to install this. For the distribution, I recommend using (Ubuntu)[https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/latest/howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2/]. 

If you run into trouble or errors in the WSL installation, (here)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting] is a helpful guide to troubleshoot common issues. If you still need help, please come to the next workshop session we hold to ask for help! 

## Further Reading

(This)[https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/] is a nice guide to Bash including more technical details on Bash and scripting. 

### HPC (High Performance Computing)

Often in bioinformatics you will need to work on the command line because your datasets are too large for your laptop, so you remote connect to a server with much much much more computing power (think hundreds of GB RAM instead of the 8-16GB on your laptop.) This is where your bash skills come in handy, because often your only iterface with the HPC server is through a command line. 

(This)[https://icl-rcs-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hpc/getting-started/] is a helpful guide to working with Imperial's HPC system. Note that working on a different HPC cluster from a different institution may differ in certain details, but the main ideas remain the same! 

Imperial offers (Introduction to HPC workshops)[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/early-career-researcher-institute/learning-and-development/courses-by-programme/research-computing-and-data-science/introduction-to-hpc/] multiple times in the year. Note the prerequisites are existing access to the Imperial HPC system and a working knowledge of the Linux command line (file management commands (pwd, mkdir, cd, cp, mv, rm, cat, head, tail) and the nano text editor.)

### Cheat Sheets

As you may have noticed, working in the command line with Bash requires remembering a lot of little commands. Cheat Sheets can help you save all the important information in one place to look back on when you've forgotten something. 

(This)[https://adibro.github.io/Data-Science-Resources/Cheat-Sheets/CL-Git/Command-Line_Cheat-Sheet.pdf] is a helpful command line cheat sheet. 

And (this)[https://devhints.io/bash] is a helpful bash scripting cheat sheet. 

If you're at all interested, (this)[https://devhints.io/vim] is a nice Vim cheat sheet.
